The Battleship game is a classic naval warfare strategy game played on a grid. It involves two players who take turns calling out guesses on the coordinates of the opponent's fleet of ships. Each player has a set of ships of varying sizes placed on their own grid. The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships using fewer attempts than the opponent does against them.
